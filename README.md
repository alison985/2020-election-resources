### Texting
* [Open Progress](https://www.openprogress.com/text-troop) is  Amy's favorite, but they don't always have campaigns open
* [Resistance Labs](https://resistancelabs.com/text) almost always has campaigns open but the support and software are not quite as good as Open Progress
* [Democracy for America](http://act.democracyforamerica.com/survey/Text2PAV201011/) is a text banking event on October 11 that Amy's planning to do
* [Democrats.org](https://events.democrats.org/?event_type=3) has some text banking options as well
* Lots of individual campaigns have their own texting programs, so if there's a candidate you're particularly excited about, you can sign up to text or phone bank through the campaign website.
  * Lauren Underwood's campaign is done taking text bank volunteers.
